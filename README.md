Image classification: See the PerceptionTask1Res.ipynb for a notebook with our approach. Parameters in the second cell are adjustable, and may be tuned to modify performance. To use, set the path to the data set (we assume data is located in the same directory i.e. ./<data>) and run the script. Functions within the notebook are used to create the data loader, train the model, and save the submission csv file. We used PyTorch Torchvision (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) to help make this project.
